Write a solution to find the IDs of the users who visited without making any transactions and the number of times they made these types of visits.
Return the result table sorted in any order.
The result format is in the following example.

SELECT
    visits.customer_id,
    COUNT(*) AS count_no_trans
FROM visits
LEFT JOIN transactions ON visits.visit_id = transactions.visit_id
WHERE transactions.transaction_id IS NULL
GROUP BY 1;
